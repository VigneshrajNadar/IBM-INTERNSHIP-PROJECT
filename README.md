# 💬 Admitly – AI-Powered College Admission Assistant

An AI-powered admission agent designed to help students, parents, and counselors explore academic opportunities, check eligibility, compare institutions, and track applications. Built using IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), **Admitly** offers multilingual, document-grounded guidance based on verified university and education board documents.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many students and parents face confusion navigating the complex college admission process. Issues like inconsistent information across institutions, unclear eligibility criteria, changing deadlines, and lack of counseling create anxiety and misinformation—especially in rural and underserved regions.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

An AI assistant trained using **IBM Watsonx.ai** that delivers accurate, real-time, document-based responses about courses, colleges, entrance exams, eligibility, fees, quotas, and more. It uses **RAG** to extract answers directly from verified educational documents and supports multilingual, conversational access to higher education guidance.
